# SUPERCON Random Forest
This notebook reproduces the results of [Stanev *et al.*](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41524-018-0085-8), which uses only atomic attributes to determine whether the critical temperatures of superconductors are above or below 10 K. Data files from the NIMS SUPERCON database that were used to reproduce the results are included.
